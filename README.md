1. Data collection file conatains code to perform the data preprocessing steps. It includes handling missing values and calculation of AQI as it was not given explicitly in the dataset downloaded.
2. A attempt to perform Zero-shot learning was attempted. However, I'm not satisfied with my results but I can still improve it.
3. LSTM is implemented for the dataset succesfully.
4. [optional] I tried to implement the 'Time Series Transformer' model from hugging face but it didn't have its tokenizer and being novice i found challenges in completing this task.
